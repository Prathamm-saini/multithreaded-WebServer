## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Testing** – Send concurrent HTTP requests to your Java server.  
- **Performance Metrics** – View average response time, throughput, and success rates.  
- **Modern UI** – Clean, dark-themed interface with glassmorphism design.  
- **Live Logging** – Monitor all requests and responses in real-time.  
- **Responsive Design** – Works perfectly on desktop and mobile.  
- **Simple Setup** – No complex configuration required.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running, ensure you have:

- A **Java multi-threaded server** running on **port 9010**.  
- A `/test` endpoint that accepts **GET** requests.  
- **CORS** enabled on your server for local testing.

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Prathamm-saini/multithreaded-WebServer.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd multithreaded-WebServer

🏃‍♂️ Quick Start
Start your Java server on port 9010 with /test endpoint.

Open the tester in your web browser.

Set the number of concurrent requests (default: 10).

Click "Test Server" to begin performance testing.

View results and logs in real-time.

🎯 Usage
Basic Testing
Enter number of concurrent requests (1–1000).

Click "Test Server".

Monitor real-time results and logs.

Understanding Results
Average Response Time – Mean time for successful requests.

Throughput – Requests processed per second.

Success Rate – Percentage of successful requests.

Real-time Logs – Individual request status and timing.

⚡ Performance Testing
The tester evaluates:

Concurrency Handling – How well your server handles multiple simultaneous requests.

Response Time – Average time to process requests under load.

Throughput – Requests per second your server can handle.

Reliability – Success rate under concurrent load.

📌 UI Layout
Sidebar – Navigation and upcoming features (single-threaded, thread pool servers).

Main Panel – Primary testing interface for multi-threaded server.

Results Section – Displays performance metrics and status.

Logs Panel – Real-time monitoring with color-coded status.

### Key Improvements:
- Added **section separators** for better scanning.
- Used **bold keywords** and `code` blocks for technical terms.
- Grouped related information together (e.g., prerequisites before install).
- Improved **bullet alignment and spacing** so it doesn’t feel cramped.
- Images are now **above the fold** so the project looks attractive right away.

If you want, I can also **add badges** (GitHub stars, license, tech stack) at the top so it looks like a polished open-source project. That would make it feel way more professional.
